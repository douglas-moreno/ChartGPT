## Generate Charts using OpenAI ChatGPT and Vega-Lite

This is an application to generate charts using Vega-Lite and integrating with OpenAI, the Artificial Inteligence of the moment.

### Laravel

Laravel is the framework that I'm using to create this application and you can check the Lavavel's documentation at [Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs)

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

### Vega-Lite
#### A Grammar of Interactive Graphics

Vega-Lite is a high-level grammar of interactive graphics. It provides a concise, declarative JSON syntax to create an expressive range of visualizations for data analysis and presentation.
